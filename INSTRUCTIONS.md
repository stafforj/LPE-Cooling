# Build Instructions and Notes

### Operating Principles

Thermocouples measure temperature at a junction between two dissimilar metals/conductors using the [Seebeck effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple). In thermocouple acquisition systems, there are two main requirements. Firstly, the voltage generated by the hot junction temperature of the thermocouple is low and requires amplification. Secondly, this voltage does not provide a reading of temperature by itself. Absolute temperature measurements at the hot junction are obtained using a reference sensor that measures a known temperature. This is known as cold junction compensation. In this build, we use the MAX31855 amplifier which includes cold junction compensation. This is designed for Type-K thermocouples and -200°C to +1350°C output in 0.25°C increments. We connect multiple amplifiers to a prototype HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) that can mount directly onto the header of a Raspberry Pi single board computer. This is then used to communicate with the hardware through the GPIO, record the measurements, and display the temperatures in real-time on a computer screen.
