## Bill of Materials

The BoM is split into the main components for the cooling system and additional components that are optional. These additional parts facilitate coolant recirculation, or if using an external chiller to provide the cooling function. The optional components listed below add greater cost to the build (relative to the main component costs). This cost could be reduced by moving to other types of fittings and tubing (e.g., brass fittings and copper tubing).

## Design & Construction

### CAD files

A total of six components from the cooling system are 3D printed parts. The CAD (.stl) files for printing these parts are located within the folder `./CAD/`.

### Construction

The CAD files were printed using a fused-deposition-modeling (FDM) printer (Ultimaker S3, 0.2mm layer thickness, 20\% infill, no supports). Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) was selected as the filament material for the printing process due to its ability to tolerate high temperatures (~ 70-80 Â°C), its mechanical properties, and chemical resistance to certain oils and solvents. 

In this build, the components are exposed to water and ice. Although PETG is compatible with water, the layers resulting from the FDM process can create sites for fluid leakages in the finished part. To remove the risk of leaks, the 3D printed parts were coated with a thin film silicon-based conformal coating (three spray coats ~ 100 microns thickness). To show the visual effect of this, a sample part was 3D printed, masked, and partially covered with a single spray coat (~ 25 microns). The difference between the coated and uncoated PETG surface is shown in the image below. The conformal coating covers the layers and insterstices, sealing the printed part and preventing liquid leaks. This surface coating is mechanically robust. As the surfaces in contact with the coolant and product are a different material than PETG, the chemical resistance of coated parts should be re-assessed for applications where a coolant other than water/ice is used.

Once printed, the parts were coated with three spray coats and allowed to cure at room temperature for 24 hours between coatings. All components of the cooling system are shown in the image below.

![Component breakdown](./Images/all-vessel-components.png)

Components `1`, `4` and `9` were bonded to the synthesis vessel (Kenwood BLP31.D0WG) using a sealant adhesive. The vessel spout with integrated thermocouple mounting (Component `4`), required modifications to the synthesis vessel before the bonding process. A 15 mm diameter hole was drilled at the top and centre of the vessel. This hole allows filling the vessel with precursor materials from the top (shown later). A second 4 mm diameter hole, located 20 mm (centre-to-centre) from the centre of the vessel, was drilled to accomodate the thermocouple probe insertion for measuring process temperature.  The thermocouple probe is inserted into component `4` at the desired depth, and the part then bonded to the top of the vessel.

The complete assembly instructions are discussed in the following sections. The following image shows the barebone assembly of printed parts and synthesis vessel without EPDM pipe adapters. The design of the spout also facilitates product sampling during processing using a 10 mL pipette.
